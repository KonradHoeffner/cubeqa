    "description": "As an increasing amount of statistical data is published as RDF, intuitive ways of satisfying information needs and getting new insights out of this type of data becomes increasingly important. Question answering systems provide intuitive access to data by translating natural language queries into SPARQL, which is the native query language of RDF knowledge bases. Statistical data, however, is structurally very different from other data and cannot be queried using existing approaches. Building upon a question corpus established in previous work, we created a benchmark for evaluating questions on statistical Linked Data in order to evaluate statistical question answering algorithms and to stimulate further research. Furthermore, we designed a question answering algorithm for statistical data, which covers a wide range of question types. To our knowledge, this is the first question answering approach for statistical RDF data and could open up a new research area. Apart from providing evaluation results, we discuss future challenges in this field.",
